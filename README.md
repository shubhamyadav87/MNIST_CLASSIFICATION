MNIST Classification
Overview
This project is focused on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using machine learning algorithms. The MNIST dataset is a popular benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision, consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). The goal of this project is to build and evaluate models that can accurately classify these digits.

Dataset
The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image, with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255. The dataset is commonly used for training and testing machine learning models due to its simplicity and accessibility.

Approach
Data Preprocessing: The first step involves preprocessing the data, which may include tasks such as resizing the images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Selection: Next, various machine learning algorithms can be explored for classification, including but not limited to:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Model Training: The selected models are trained on the training dataset using appropriate training algorithms and techniques. Hyperparameter tuning may also be performed to optimize model performance.

Model Evaluation: Once trained, the models are evaluated on the testing dataset to assess their accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics. Cross-validation techniques may be employed to ensure robustness of the results.

Deployment (Optional): Depending on the project requirements, the trained model may be deployed for inference on new unseen data. This could involve creating a web application, API, or integrating the model into existing systems.

Results
The results of the classification task, including model performance metrics and any insights gained from the analysis, will be documented and presented in this section.
